# Introduction

This project is an **in-development fullstack web application** for a multiplayer quiz game based on the popular **“Would You Rather”** format. The platform is designed to let users join interactive game sessions, answer fun and thought-provoking “would you rather” questions, and compete or collaborate with others in real time through a modern web interface.

The goal of this project is to provide a seamless, engaging, and scalable multiplayer experience — blending real-time gameplay mechanics with secure, user-friendly web technology. It will feature player matchmaking, live question rounds, score tracking, and interactive chat capabilities once fully developed.

At the current stage of development, the focus is on building the **authentication backend**. This includes setting up the user model, registration and login endpoints, token-based authentication (JWT or session-based), and secure password management. The foundation laid here will support role-based access control and persistent user data for future gameplay and social features.
